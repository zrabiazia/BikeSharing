# BikeSharing Analysis
## Overview:
in this module, we are helping Kate to study and analyze data “Citi bike sharing” for New York city. Kate wants to open a bike sharing business in Des Moines city. Kate also wants to make a visual presentation for potential investors to get going with her business idea. We are using Tableau to create the visual presentation. 
Tableau is a powerful tool for visual presentation. It has a specific purpose: to provide data visualization that is easy to use and understand. We will be creating a visual story to:
•	Show the top user location, bike utilization and trip duration
•	Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all the riders and genders
•	Show the number of bike trips by users for each hour by each day of the week
•	Show the number of bike trips for each user for each day of the week
## Results:
There are 8 visual slides that I prepared for the potential presentation:
# Top Starting Locations:

The Top starting locations were determined by start station latitudes and end station longitudes. The colors specify the locations where the activity was most or less. Big circles show the most activity, the medium circle shows the medium activity and small shows less activity at those stations.

# Bike Utilization:

The bike utilization was determined: Tripduration by colors and size marks and Bikeid.  The usage of bike is showed by colors and circles. The big circle shows the most usage of the bike and small shows the less usage. Colors also represent the usage of bikes.
#Checkout Time for User:
  
The checkout time for user presentation was determined with Tripduration by minute and hour, filtered by hours and minutes. This shows the number of user’s checkout the bike and how long the bike is checked out for.

# Checkout Times by Gender:
 
This graph was determined with Tripduration by minute and hour, Gender by color and filter.
In this graph color shows the gender (unknown, male, female) usage by minute and hours. 
#Trips by Weekday for Each hour:
 
This graph shows the trips for each day by hours. It was determined by start time with hour and stop time with weekday.




# Trips by Gender (weekday per hour):
 
This graph is showing the trips for everyday and each hour by gender (unknown, male, female).
#User Trips by Gender by Weekday:
 
This presentation shows the trips for user’s (customer, subscriber) by everyday and gender (unknown, male, female)
# Trip Duration by Birth year:

This graph shows the user’s birth year and how long the trip is. It was determined with birthyear and average of Tripduration.

## Summary:
Kate wanted the help to create a visual presentation with Tableau for potential investors for her Bikesharing business. We created the story based on analysis of bake trip duration, top busy locations, trip checkout by gender and locations, trip checkout by user on weekdays and each hour of the day.

The top starting locations analysis shows that people rent bikes from those location on daily basis and multiple times. The bike utilization graph shows that bikes have been used multiple time and by multiple users. The top starting locations and bike utilization are corelated with each other in terms of the usage of bikes. 

The checkout time by users display the bike checkout by minutes and how many users checkout the bikes the most in one hour. The checkout time by Gender also represent the bike checkout by hours and minutes but divided by “UNKNOWN”, “MALE”, “FEMALE”. The comparison between these graphs are the men, women and other categories are using bike sharing hourly and between 4 to 6pm is the most users using the checkout for the bike trips.

Trips by gender, weekdays and hours display the activity between different genders by each hour for each weekday and how long the bike trip was. Users trips by gender by weekday shows that there is more activity for subscribers for bike usage and male use the bike more than women and other gender type. 
In the end trip duration chart display the activity by birth year and average of Tripduration. The peak average trip duration shows in 1890 and 1970, the rest stayed in range of 1200 to 1600.
